#### Who am I?

I was born in Australia a long time ago.

I wrote my first computer program -- in Fortran -- in 1968.

I came to the United States for graduate school, and stayed.  I have the first PhD in Computer Science granted by the University of Rochester.  As an undergraduate, I assembled a card catalog out of 3x5 index cards; as a graduate student, I programmed a journal article index on an IBM mainframe.  After a career in the software industry that included equal parts boom and bust, I retired to Las Vegas, where I pursue an interest in public library cataloging, including cataloging models, metadata quality and OPAC UX/UI.

#### What is here on GitHub?

I have three public repositories on GitHub:
* https://github.com/lagbolt/library which contains my writing, including presentations
* https://github.com/lagbolt/catalog-errors which contains a collection of Python programs for scraping library catalogs and analyzing catalog data
* https://github.com/lagbolt/mbox which contains a couple of small programs for processing mbox-format email archives
